# Free Email Notifications Setup Guide

## Overview
Your e-commerce application now includes **completely free** email notifications that will be sent automatically when orders are placed. This includes:
- **Customer confirmation email**: Sent to the customer with order details
- **Admin notification email**: Sent to admin with new order information

## Why Email Instead of SMS?
- ✅ **100% Free** - No per-message costs
- ✅ **No limits** - Send unlimited emails
- ✅ **Professional** - Rich HTML templates with order details
- ✅ **Reliable** - Works with any email provider
- ✅ **Easy setup** - Just need a Gmail account

## Setup Steps

### 1. Use Your Gmail Account
You can use any Gmail account for sending emails. No special setup required!

### 2. Enable App Passwords (Required for Gmail)
1. Go to your **Google Account settings**: [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com)
2. Click **"Security"** in the left sidebar
3. Under **"Signing in to Google"**, click **"App passwords"**
4. You may need to verify your identity
5. Select **"Mail"** and **"Other (Custom name)"**
6. Enter "Para Bell E-commerce" as the name
7. Click **"Generate"**
8. **Copy the 16-character password** (you'll need this for the .env file)

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (FREE with Gmail)
EMAIL_USER="your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-16-character-app-password"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@gmail.com"  # Optional: different email for admin notifications
```

### 4. Example .env Configuration
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/para_bell_ecommerce?schema=public"

# Next.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email Configuration (FREE)
EMAIL_USER="parabell.store@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"  # Your 16-character app password
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@parabell.com"  # Optional: different admin email
```

## How It Works

### When an Order is Placed:
1. **Order is created** in the database
2. **Customer receives** a beautiful HTML email with:
   - Order confirmation and ID
   - Itemized product list
   - Total amount and payment method
   - Shipping address
   - Professional branding

3. **Admin receives** an alert email with:
   - Customer information
   - Complete order details
   - Action required notice

### Email Templates Include:
- **Professional HTML design** with your brand colors
- **Order summary table** with products and prices
- **Customer and shipping information**
- **Payment method details**
- **Plain text fallback** for all email clients

## Testing Your Setup

1. **Place a test order** with a real email address
2. **Check your email** (both customer and admin emails)
3. **Monitor console logs** for email sending status
4. **Verify delivery** in both inboxes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Make sure you're using the **App Password**, not your regular Gmail password
   - Verify the App Password is exactly 16 characters

2. **"Email not sending"**
   - Check that `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set correctly
   - Ensure App Passwords are enabled in your Google Account

3. **"Emails going to spam"**
   - This is normal for new email addresses
   - Add your sending email to contacts to avoid spam filters

### Console Logs to Check:
- Success: `Order confirmation email sent to customer@gmail.com, Message ID: <...>`
- Error: `Failed to send order confirmation email: [error details]`

## Cost: $0.00

- ✅ **Gmail**: Free
- ✅ **Nodemailer**: Free
- ✅ **No per-email charges**
- ✅ **No monthly fees**
- ✅ **Unlimited emails**

## Alternative Email Providers

If you prefer not to use Gmail, you can use any email provider that supports SMTP:

### Outlook/Hotmail:
```env
EMAIL_USER="your-email@outlook.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-password"
# The service will auto-detect 'outlook'
```

### Custom SMTP Server:
```env
EMAIL_USER="your-email@yourdomain.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-password"
SMTP_HOST="mail.yourdomain.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
```

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to version control
- **Use App Passwords** instead of your main Gmail password
- **Keep credentials secure** and don't share them
